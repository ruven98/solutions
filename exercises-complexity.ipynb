    "A bit of history on the topic: Volker Strassen published an algorithm in 1969 that proved that this general matrix multiplication algorithm was not optimal, his algorithm achieved $\\approx O(n^{2.807})$. The optimal complexity in fact remains unknown, but as of April 2024 the best announced bound on the asymptotic complexity of a matrix multiplication algorithm is $O(n^{2.371552})$, by Williams, Xu, Xu, and Zhou. Yet, this and similar improvements to Strassen are not typically used in practice, because they are so-called galactic algorithms: the constant coefficient hidden by the big O notation is so large that they are only worthwhile for matrices that are too large to handle on standard present-day computers (From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_matrix_multiplication)"

    "Does this all matter today given that computers are so fast? You could try to compute only say the 120th elements of the Fibonacci sequence with `fibonacci_recursive(120)` from the previous exercise, but will eventually need to terminate the notebook. In contrast, the iterative implementation for computing the nth element of the series has time complexity in just $O(n)$ and is very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding some basics of computational complexity theory can help to spot slow patterns in code as a researcher and think about some ways to potentially change them if possible. Yet, beyond the basics we covered here, the field has significant relevance for societies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) system is widely used to secure data transmission. A user identifies with a publically known number $k$ (called a public key) which is the product of two very large prime numbers (these two prime numbers, however, are only known to the user and are called the private key). Messages to the user are encrypted using $k$ (which is publically known), but can only be read by a person who knows the two prime numbers behind $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how this setup has two very specific properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is easy to check for every candidate pair of prime numbers whether they indeed multiply to $k$ or not (one just has to multiply them)\n",
    "- Yet, there is no (known) algorithm which can do the reverse, i.e. figure out the two prime numbers behind $k$, in polynomial time (see the lecture slides for a definition of polynomial time).<a name=\"footnote1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1) Existing algorithms require a prohibitively long time to run for large prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could there be an algorithm that manages to find the two primes in polynomial time? This is what is called the PvsNP problem. If there was such an algorithm, it would break among other things the RSA system. [PvsNP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem) is one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics and computer science and carries a US$1,000,000 [prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems) for the first correct solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "A great non-technical summary and discussion of the PvsNP problem is in this [In Our Time podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06mtms8).
